# Project Brief: Virtual Try-On Lab

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a web application that enables users to virtually try on clothing items using Google Cloud's Virtual Try-On (VTO) AI technology. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for uploading personal photos and visualizing how different garments would look on them.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **User Image Upload**: Users must be able to upload a photo of themselves or capture one using their device's camera.
- **Clothing Catalog**: The application must display a gallery of available clothing items for users to select.
- **Virtual Try-On Functionality**:
    - **Single Item Try-On**: Allow users to select a specific clothing item and see the generated try-on image.
    - **Batch Processing**: Provide an option for users to try on all available clothing items in a single operation.
- **Results Display**:
    - Display generated try-on images in a clear, organized gallery.
    - Show the status of each try-on, indicating success or failure.
- **Progress Tracking**: For batch operations, a real-time progress indicator must be shown to the user.
- **Image Management**:
    - Users must be able to download individual try-on results.
    - Users must be able to download all successful results in a single batch (e.g., as a ZIP file).
- **Responsive Design**: The application interface must be functional and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 3. Key Goals

- **User Experience**: To provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users to visualize clothing on themselves without needing to physically wear it.
- **Performance**: To ensure that try-on operations, especially batch processing, are handled efficiently with clear feedback to the user.
- **Extensibility**: The system should be designed to easily accommodate new clothing items.
- **Reliability**: The application should gracefully handle potential errors during the VTO process and communicate them clearly to the user.
