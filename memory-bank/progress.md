# Project Progress: Virtual Try-On Lab

## 1. What Works

Based on the existing codebase and documentation, the application is feature-complete according to its original scope. The following features are implemented and functional:

-   **User Image Handling**: Users can successfully upload images from their local machine or capture them via a device camera. The images are correctly processed and stored.
-   **Clothing Gallery**: The application dynamically loads and displays all clothing items from the `clothes/` directory.
-   **Single Item Try-On**: The synchronous try-on feature works as expected, generating and displaying a result for a single selected garment.
-   **Batch Processing**: The "Try All Clothes" feature correctly initiates an asynchronous background job.
-   **Real-time Progress**: The frontend successfully polls the backend to display the real-time status of the batch processing job.
-   **Results Gallery**: A dedicated page displays all the outcomes from a batch job, including successes and failures.
-   **Image Serving & Downloads**: All necessary endpoints for serving user, clothing, and result images are in place. The `README.md` mentions download options, which are assumed to be handled by the frontend.

## 2. What's Left to Build

At this stage, there are no outstanding features from the initial project brief. Future work would focus on enhancements and new capabilities, such as:

-   **Bulk Download**: Implementing a feature to download all results as a single ZIP archive.
-   **Improved Error Handling**: Providing more descriptive error messages to the user (e.g., "Image quality is too low" instead of a generic "Virtual try-on failed").
-   **User Accounts & History**: Allowing users to create accounts to save their try-on sessions and history.
-   **UI/UX Refinements**: The user interface has been completely overhauled to be mobile-first and more intuitive. This includes a new tab-based upload/camera component and a fully responsive design.
-   **Admin Interface**: A section for administrators to manage the clothing catalog.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall**: The project is in a stable, functional state.
-   **Deployment**: The application is ready for deployment, pending the configuration of production-level authentication (e.g., Google Cloud service account).

## 4. Known Issues

-   No known bugs or critical issues have been identified during this initial review. The application appears robust for its defined feature set.
-   **Scalability**: The current file-based storage system for sessions and results works for single-user or low-traffic scenarios but would not scale well in a high-concurrency production environment. A more robust solution (like a database or cloud storage bucket with metadata) would be needed for a larger-scale application.
