# Active Context: Comprehensive UI/UX Overhaul

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus has been a complete overhaul of the user interface to be mobile-first and more intuitive, based on user feedback and modern design principles.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **HTML Refactoring (`templates/index.html`)**:
    -   Replaced the old upload section with a new, tab-based component for switching between "Upload" and "Camera" modes.
    -   Streamlined the HTML structure to support the new design.

-   **JavaScript Overhaul (`static/js/main.js`)**:
    -   Implemented the logic for the new tabbed interface, allowing users to seamlessly switch between upload and camera modes.
    -   Re-wired all event listeners to work with the new DOM structure.
    -   Maintained all core functionalities (file handling, camera capture, API calls) while adapting them to the new UI.

-   **CSS Mobile-First Refactoring (`static/css/styles.css`)**:
    -   Completely rewrote the stylesheet to follow a mobile-first architecture. Base styles are now optimized for small screens.
    -   Used `min-width` media queries to progressively enhance the layout for tablets and desktops, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
    -   Added specific styles for the new upload component, ensuring it is responsive and touch-friendly.

## 3. Next Steps

-   The application's frontend is now significantly more robust, modern, and user-friendly, especially on mobile devices.
-   The next step is to update the `progress.md` file to reflect these improvements and then await further tasks.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **Mobile-First Approach**: The decision to refactor the CSS to be mobile-first (rather than patching the existing desktop-first code) results in a more performant and scalable solution.
-   **Component-Based UI**: The new upload section is designed as a self-contained component, making the code more organized and easier to manage.
-   **User Experience**: The new design, inspired by the user-provided image, simplifies the initial user interaction and makes the choice between uploading and using the camera much clearer.
