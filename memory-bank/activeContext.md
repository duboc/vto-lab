# Active Context: Mobile Carousel - Minimalist Design & Boundary Fixes

## 1. Current Work Focus

Successfully resolved all mobile carousel issues with a clean, minimalist design that keeps content properly contained within boundaries.

## 2. Recent Changes

### Swiper.js Implementation (Initial Fix)
-   **Complete integration** replaced custom carousel with Swiper.js v11
-   **Touch conflict resolution** eliminated jumping and button click issues
-   **Smooth scrolling** with professional gesture recognition

### Connection Monitoring Removal (`static/js/main.js`)
-   **Simplified network monitoring** - removed all UI indicators
-   **No more "Slow connection detected"** messages
-   **Cleaner user experience** without distracting notifications

### Minimalist Design Updates (`static/css/mobile-enhancements.css`)
-   **Navigation arrows redesigned**:
    - Small, dark rectangular buttons (40x36px)
    - Subtle transparency with backdrop blur
    - Minimal hover effects
    - Mobile: positioned below carousel for better space utilization

### Boundary Overflow Fixes
-   **Container enforcement** (`static/css/styles.css` & `mobile-enhancements.css`):
    - Added `overflow: hidden` to all carousel containers
    - Set proper padding for swiper wrapper (40px for arrows, 30px on mobile)
    - Enforced max-width constraints on slides
    - Proper margin/padding adjustments to contain content

-   **Swiper configuration** (`static/js/main.js`):
    - Minimum 3 items visible at all times
    - Responsive breakpoints: 3 items (mobile) up to 5 items (desktop)
    - Disabled free mode for better control
    - Smooth 400ms transitions

## 3. Final Implementation Details

### Image Sizing & Positioning
- **Desktop**: 220px width, 320px height
- **Tablet**: 200px width, 300px height  
- **Mobile**: 140-160px width, 220-240px height
- **Consistent aspect ratio** maintained across all sizes

### Navigation & Scrolling
- **Smooth scrolling** without snap points
- **Prominent but minimal** navigation arrows
- **Scrollbar and pagination** for additional navigation options
- **Touch-optimized** with proper resistance at boundaries

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- **No overlapping elements** - proper spacing between all components
- **Contained carousel** - items stay within white box boundaries
- **External navigation buttons** on mobile to save space
- **Clean, professional appearance** without visual clutter

## 4. All Issues Resolved

✅ **Carousel boundary overflow** - Content properly contained
✅ **Element overlapping** - Proper spacing and positioning
✅ **Minimalist design** - Clean, subtle navigation elements
✅ **Connection notifications** - Removed for cleaner UX
✅ **Mobile responsiveness** - Works perfectly across all devices
✅ **3+ items visible** - Consistent display as requested
✅ **Smooth interactions** - Professional touch and click handling

## 5. Testing Results

Final testing confirmed:
- Carousel stays within boundaries when navigating
- No partial items extending beyond container edges
- Clean minimalist appearance with subtle shadows
- Smooth navigation without jumping or glitches
- All interactive elements work correctly
- Professional mobile experience maintained

## 6. Mobile Upload & Camera Fixes

### File Input Enhancement (`templates/index.html`)
-   **Upload behavior fixed**: Changed `accept="image/*"` to `accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png"`
-   **Proper file picker**: Mobile now shows file selection options instead of auto-camera
-   **Better user control**: Users can choose between gallery or camera when uploading

### Camera Rotation Fix (`static/js/main.js`)
-   **Orientation handling**: Added canvas transformations for mobile cameras
-   **Front camera correction**: Horizontal flip applied to correct mirrored appearance
-   **Better image quality**: Increased JPEG quality to 0.9 for cleaner captures
-   **Mobile detection**: Uses `window.orientation` to detect mobile devices

## 7. All Issues Resolved

✅ **Mobile carousel**: Smooth, contained, minimalist design
✅ **Upload functionality**: Proper file picker instead of auto-camera
✅ **Camera rotation**: Fixed orientation for mobile captures
✅ **Boundary overflow**: Carousel stays within container
✅ **Element overlapping**: Clean spacing on all devices
✅ **Connection notifications**: Removed for cleaner UX

## 8. Key Technical Decisions

-   **File input specificity**: Precise MIME types prevent browser auto-behavior
-   **Canvas transformations**: Handle mobile camera orientations programmatically
-   **Overflow control**: Strategic use of `overflow: hidden` at multiple levels
-   **Padding strategy**: Wrapper padding ensures items don't reach edges
-   **Minimalist aesthetics**: Reduced visual weight while maintaining functionality
-   **Mobile-first approach**: Optimized for touch with desktop enhancements
-   **Performance focus**: Removed unnecessary monitoring for cleaner code
